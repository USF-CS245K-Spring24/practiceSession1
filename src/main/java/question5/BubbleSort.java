 * Fill in the missing code of the bubble sort so that it sorts the subarray from index low to index arr.length-1 in descending order.
 * For instance, if the array is {4, 19, 0, 3, 6, 2, 8} and low = 2, the result should be: 4, 19, 8, 6, 3, 2, 0.
 *
 * Submit your solution to github (so that you know how to do it during the actual exam).
